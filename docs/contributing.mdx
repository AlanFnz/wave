<TitleCard title="Contributing">
    Everyone at FREE NOW is welcome to make contributions to the design system. To make sure that everyone can contribute,
    we have decided to write out a few steps that help you add your contributions.
</TitleCard>

## Reporting Bugs

The design system is used in many places. We have a hard time keeping our eyes on all of them to keep up with the issues
youâ€™re having. If you see something amiss, please report it via a [Jira issue](https://jira.intapps.it/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa)
in the "Wave Design System" project so we have insight in order to resolve it.

If you are unsure if what you found is a bug, feel free to ask in the #ask-wave Slack channel for advice.

## Submitting Components

When you feel that a specific feature, component, or essential is missing, read this section to find out how you can
submit a new pattern to the design system.

To figure out if it belongs in the design system, please check out the workflow below to scope whether a new component
should be added to the design system.

<ImageModal src={workflowImageUrl} alt="Workflow" />

This is the submission process for new components, essentials and improvements to existing components:

1. [Create a Jira issue](https://jira.intapps.it/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa) in the "Wave Design System" with the
basic information and gather feedback from the maintainers and your fellow developers in the #ask-wave Slack channel
1. Ask the design team to create a design for the component and publish it to the Design System project in Zeplin
1. Align with the maintainers and other developers on the API of the component
4. Move the issue into the "Ready for Development" status and you or another developer can now start building
5. After the development is done, open a pull request, keeping the
[development guidelines](https://stash.intapps.it/projects/DS/repos/wave/browse/CONTRIBUTING.md) in mind. You will get
feedback here, but we recommend check-ins with designers and developers during the development
6. With the required approvals (2 from development and 1 from design), you can merge your branch to master and it will be
released by the maintainers in the next version of `@freenow/wave`

If you need any help during the process, don't hesitate to reach out to one of the maintainers or the #ask-wave
Slack channel.

### Roadmap

If you're looking for something to work on, a great place to start is our [issues labeled up for grabs](https://jira.intapps.it/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20%22Wave%20Design%20System%22%20AND%20status%20%3D%20%22Ready%20for%20Development%22%20ORDER%20BY%20Rang%20)!
If you've got a feature that you'd like to implement, be sure to check out the Jira Board to make sure it hasn't already
been started on.

## Improve Documentation

The documentation is the most valuable part of the design system. It is hard to keep it updated and informative enough to
help others.

We encourage you to add to the documentation page any information you were lack of when using the library.
Descriptions, FAQs and explanations are all valuable for us! Documentation PRs are the fastest way to get involved.

All the documentation pages are Markdown-based. You don't need to know how to write code to contribute.


## Other Contributions

Not all contributions have to be made in design, code and pull requests. You can for example help your team adopt the
design system components or answer questions in the #ask-wave channel your fellow developers might be having.
